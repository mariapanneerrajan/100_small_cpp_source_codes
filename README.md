# 100_small_cpp_source_codes

Hey Software Engineers,

This is a software-engineering learning series I have challenged myself to do.

Each week, I will be writing at-least one small C++ application and sharing it's source-code with you all via GitHub along with a video-screen-recording of me writing it.

If any of these source-codes seem useful for you, feel free to use them, :)
