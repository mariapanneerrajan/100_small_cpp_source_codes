# 100_small_cpp_source_codes

**Day: 001/100**

Hey Software Engineers,

Here is a new software-engineering learning series I have challenged myself to start from today onwards.

For the next 100 weekdays (Monday-Friday), I will be writing one small C++ application each day and sharing it's source-code with you all via GitHub along with a sped-up video-screen-recording of it.

If any of these source-codes seem useful for you, feel free to use them, :)
